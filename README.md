 This is a Jetpack Compose App for my first-semester mobile applications class. It is a prototype of a Google Maps-style navigation between rooms on the second floor of our school. This was a collaborative project, yet I was the main developer behind most of the project. 

 Technologies Used:  
  - Jetpack Compose
